size curve, just like speed curve
make server send level data so no pulling/pushhing necessary just for levels?

show time spent on level

server remembering players (is this possible without accounts? maybe connectID is consistent? but surely it wont on ip change)
	i would be nice to know how many maps each player has survived
more levels
leaderboard?

multithreading?

global variable specific to each thread!
__declspec(thread)

there is a bug. if you die on the same frame you beat the level, you spawn dead??
